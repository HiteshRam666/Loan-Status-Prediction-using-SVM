## [About Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication/data)

Among all industries, insurance domain has the largest use of analytics & data science methods. This data set would provide you enough taste of working on data sets from insurance companies, what challenges are faced, what strategies are used, which variables influence the outcome etc. This is a classification problem. The data has 615 rows and 13 columns.

**Problem-----**
Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.

## About Algorithm 

**Support Vector Machine**

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Though we say regression problems as well itâ€™s best suited for classification. The main objective of the SVM algorithm is to find the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can separate the data points in different classes in the feature space. The hyperplane tries that the margin between the closest points of different classes should be as maximum as possible. The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is two, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is three, then the hyperplane becomes a 2-D plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds three.
